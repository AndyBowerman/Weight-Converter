# Weight-Converter

I've used a Bootstrap layout to keep the page appearance simple and responsive and added a few custom CSS features as a lot of my projects were starting to look very similar!

I wanted to give users the option of which weight units to convert between.

The algorithms required are simple, I used if statements to call the required functions based on the users selections.

My aim is for the code to be as simple as possible to achieve my desired tasks.
